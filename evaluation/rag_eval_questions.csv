1,"According to 'A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Evolution, Current Landscape and Future Directions', what are two key ongoing challenges in deploying RAG systems and one future research direction mentioned?","The survey highlights scalability and issues related to bias and ethical concerns as key ongoing challenges for deploying RAG systems. As a future research direction, it calls for improving the robustness of RAG models while addressing broader societal implications, such as responsible and ethical deployment.","A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Evolution, Current Landscape and Future Directions"
2,"According to 'Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Study of Best Practices', name at least four RAG design factors that the authors systematically investigate.","The best-practices study investigates multiple design factors, including the size of the language model, prompt design strategies, document chunk size, size of the knowledge base, retrieval stride, query expansion techniques, the use of contrastive in-context learning knowledge bases, multilingual knowledge bases, and a Focus Mode that retrieves context at sentence level. Any four of these factors are acceptable.",Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Study of Best Practices
