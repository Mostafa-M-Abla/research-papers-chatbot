"According to 'A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Evolution, Current Landscape and Future Directions', what are two key ongoing challenges in deploying RAG systems and one future research direction mentioned?","The survey highlights scalability and issues related to bias and ethical concerns as key ongoing challenges for deploying RAG systems. As a future research direction, it calls for improving the robustness of RAG models while addressing broader societal implications, such as responsible and ethical deployment.","A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Evolution, Current Landscape and Future Directions","According to the paper ""A Comprehensive Survey of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Evolution, Current Landscape and Future Directions,"" two key ongoing challenges in deploying RAG systems are:

1. **Scalability and Efficiency**: RAG models face difficulties in handling vast and dynamically growing datasets, which require efficient retrieval algorithms. High computational costs and memory requirements hinder their deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments.

2. **Integration of Ambiguous or Unstructured Information**: There are challenges in effectively handling domain-specific contexts and the high computational overhead of complex retrieval tasks, which limit the broader applicability of RAG systems.

One future research direction mentioned in the paper is the improvement of retrieval mechanisms, particularly through the development of dynamic retrieval strategies that can adapt to changing query patterns and content requirements. This includes exploring hybrid retrieval approaches that combine various strategies to enhance the effectiveness of RAG systems.","[EvaluationResult(key='retrieval_hit', score=1.0, value=None, comment=None, correction=None, evaluator_info={}, feedback_config=None, source_run_id=UUID('0a60a1ab-a188-4bb6-8010-77440f5854d6'), target_run_id=None, extra=None), EvaluationResult(key='correctness_0_10', score=4.0, value=None, comment='The system answer identifies challenges related to scalability but introduces a different second challenge (integration of ambiguous information) instead of bias and ethical concerns.
